# Schedule Week 2

**Important:** Starting in week 2 until the end of the course, every lecture, assignment, and lab should be taught/developed in a test driven style. This means that students will have tests for every lecture and assignment that will fail at the beginning, and pass once they have completed it successfully. Depending on the lecture/assignment, tests will be written together or individually.

For the first few assignments, tests will be provided by the instructors - later on, students will have to divide up assignments into several tests and then make them pass by solving the assignment. This order (test first, feature second) is obligatory, even if counterintuitive at first.
