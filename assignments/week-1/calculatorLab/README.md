# Calculator

`git clone` this repo to start the calculator homework.

You can open `calculator.html` to see the (nonfunctional) calculator page.
You're gonna make it work!

1. `calculator.js` is provided and linked to the page for you, but it's blank,
what's the first thing you write? (Without it, your JS won't be able to find any
HTML elements on the page---why?)
2. Once you're able to get the elements on the page, you want to know about
clicks to the buttons. How can you listen to `click` events on all the buttons?
(Remember exercises 3 and 4?) For debugging purposes, make sure you can get it
so something is logged to the console whenever a button is clicked.
3. Great, now you know when clicks happen. What do you want to do when clicks
happen? Do you want to the number display? Update the operator display? Clear a
display? The answer to each of those is "sometimes", right? When, then? How do
you decide what to do?
