# Exercises for DOM 

## 1 of 3: Fix My Dom
#### Navigate to…
- <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-14/notes/tree/master/assignments/week-1/dom-exercises/fix-my-dom/">Fix My DOM</a> and open in a browser the file named first-file.html. You'll see in the browser a page with an unordered list. Your task is to use the DOM API to change the contents of first-file.html to second-file.html (below). Write your JavaScript code in a file called dom.js, which is located inside of <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-14/notes/tree/master/assignments/week-1/dom-exercises/fix-my-dom/">Fix My DOM</a> 

```html 
//first-file.html
<body>
  <section>
    <h1>update my list<h1>
    <ul>
      <li>fir</li>
      <li></li> 
      <li>third</li>
      <li>third</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</body>
```

```html
// second-file.html
<body>
  <section>
    <h1>update my list<h1>
    <ul>
      <li>first</li>
      <li>second</li>
