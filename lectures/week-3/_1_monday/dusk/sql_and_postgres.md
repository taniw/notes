Introduction To Databases!
==================

## Objectives And Scope
* Install Postgres (server / client) onto your laptop
* Understand what a database is
* Know how to start postgres
* Know how to start psql client
* Use SQL to Create a database
* Use SQL to Create a table
* Use SQL to insert, select, update, and delete data
* Understand what Primary Keys are
* Begin learning about joins and more advanced queries.

## BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING - Install Postgres.app
First, take a deep breath.  This will be a painful installation process for some of you.  Hang in there.

### Mac OSX - Install Postgres.app 
We will be using Postgres as our database to demonstrate and practice what we are learning.  Postgres can be installed many ways, but for our purposes, Postgres.app will be the best option.  Please follow the instructions below if you have not done so already.

* Go to [http://postgresapp.com/](http://postgresapp.com/)
* Download and install
* Follow the __Command-Line Tools__ here: [http://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html](http://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html)

### Ubuntu - Install Postgres.app

	
```
	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL
```


### Both Ubuntu and MAC OSX

* Verify the install was successful by typing ```psql``` in your terminal.  ```\q``` to quit.



__IF THIS DOES NOT WORK, STOP IMMEDIATELY AND GET HELP FROM AN INSTRUCTOR__


##Install	Client Gem
	
* Next install the pg gem if you have not done so already (you can see this by typing in gem list in terminal)

```
gem install pg
```
* If you get an error when installing try running using sudo with:


```
sudo gem install pg
```

# What is a database?

- Sometimes called a DBMS (Database Management System)
- It is a program that enforces structure on your data and allows a computer to quickly retreive data.
- A database should support CRUD operations.  
  - CRUD => Create, Read, Update, Delete
  
## Why Use a Database?

Why is it better than just writing to files?

* Data is structured
* Databases are transactional
* Data retrevial is fast
* Has a system for remote access
* Has a system for backup

## Pre-Lesson Exercise!!!
Spend 5 minutes researching the following questions:

* What are the different types of databases?
* What makes Postgres different?
* Why would we teach you Postgres to you? What are the Pros and Cons of using it?
* What apps/companies use Postgres?


## Types of Databases

__RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)__ The most common type of database today is a __relational database__.  Relational databases have tabular data with rows for each instance of data and columns for each attribut of that data.  Tables may refer to one another.  Relational databases typically use __SQL (Structured Query Language)__.

**Brands of RDBMS:**

* Postgres
* MySQL (Used to be very popular)
* Oracle (Commercial Product with lots of features)
* Microsoft SQL Server
* SQLite (Good for mobile development/Small applications)

__NoSQL__ There is also a school of thought called NoSql.  It is often a Key Value storage system and is not relational.  This is typically used in applications where a database does not scale well.  Example technologies include __MongoDB__, __Firebase__, __Apache Couch__, __SimpleDB__.



## Getting started with psql

If you installed Postgress.app you have access to psql from the elephant icon at the top of the screen:

* ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wdi-sf-march-2014/notes/master/DatabasesIntro/Postgres.png)

If you are using the command line:

* In your terminal, type ```psql```.  

__psql__ is the (a) command line tool to interact with postgres databases, by default it connects to the localhost database with the name of the current user


psql has some of it's own commands which begin with `\`


List all of the available databases:

```
\list
```

List all of the available tables in the current database:

```
\dt
```

There are lots of other commands which you can see with:

```
\?
```
Use `q` to exit the help screen

__ALL PSQL COMMANDS START WITH `\` __


# SQL: Structured Query Language

__A Brief History of Databases__

Before the notion of an RDBMS and a standard language for querying that data was created, there were many database venders.  Each vendor had different ways of storing data and very different ways of retreiving the data afterwards.  Moving data from one system to another was very costly.  Luckly in the 15970s SQL was created and later turned into a standard.  Modern relational databases are now based on the SQL standard, so moving from Postgres to Oracle is not nearly as much of a challenge as it used to be. 

__CRUD__

Stands for Create, Read, Update and Destroy.  This is the lifecycle of data in an application.  In SQL, CRUD can be mapped to the following __INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE__.  We will walk through examples of in this section.


__ALL SQL COMMANDS MUST BE ENDED WITH A SEMICOLON IN THE PSQL SHELL__


## Creating a Database

Most database products have the notion of separate databases.  Lets create one for the lesson.  

```
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
```

Connect to a database 

```
\connect testdb

```
Once we connect, our command prompt should look similar to this: ```testdb=#```

List our tables:

```
\list
```

## What is a schema?

A database __schema__ is the definition that describes the entire configuration of the database

##psql and SQL 

* CREATE a Database:

```
	CREATE DATABASE testdb;
```

* Connect to the new database:

```
	\connect testdb

 ->You are now connected to database "testdb" as user "stuart".
	
```

* CREATE a TABLE

```
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    email TEXT
);
```

#### Data Types

Similar to how Ruby has types of data, SQL defines types that can be stored in the DB. Here are some common ones:

* Serial
* Integer
* Numeric // Numbers are exact, no rounding error
* Float // Rounding error is possible, but operations are faster than Numeric
* Text, Varchar
* Timestamp
* Boolean (True or False)

#### What is a Primary Key?

It denotes an attribute on a table that can uniquely identify the row.

#### What does SERIAL Do?

SERIAL tells the database to automatically assign the next unused integer value to id whenever we insert into the database and do not specify id.  In general, if you have a column that is set to SERIAL, it is a good idea to let the database assign the  value for you.

* INSERT (remember single quotes for text)

```
INSERT INTO students 
(name, phone, email) 
VALUES 
('Mary Wilson', '(510)-555-5555', 'bob@example.com');

```

* SELECT

```
SELECT * FROM students;
```

```
SELECT id, email FROM students WHERE name = 'Bob Jones';
```

* UPDATE

```
UPDATE students SET email='bobby@example.com' WHERE name = 'Bob Jones';
```

* DELETE

```
DELETE from students WHERE name = 'Mary';
```

* QUIT psql 
```
/q
```

##Exercise: FishTank
* Make a new database called 'FishTank'.  
* Inside of FishTank, make a table called 'Fish'.  Each fish needs to have a name, species, age, sex, and an alive value(true or false)  
* Add 4 fish to the database: a male Wrasse, a female Parrot Fish, a  female Whale Shark, and a male Garibaldi. Name them whatever you want.  Same goes for age.
* Sequential Hermaphroditism strikes again! Change the Wrasse's sex from male to female. Read more about it [here](https://naturalreactions.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/the-mystery-of-the-fish-that-change-their-sex/)(after the exercise)
* Next, delete the 3rd fish.  Don't ask why.
* Oh no, we forgot to feed the fish!  Change all of their alive attributes to false.  
 
**Bonus:** Require age to be a positive number.  Require that species cannot be blank. Use Google!

## Connecting Tables

Let's make a teachers table:

```
CREATE TABLE teachers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    subject TEXT
);
```

Let's associate a student with a teacher. This is a middle school where a student has one teacher for the entire year.

```
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER;
```

This works great, but what happens if I delete a teacher? Or if I try to assign a teacher_id of 999, when there is no teacher with id of 999?

We can add a Foreign Key Constraint to our table that will link teacher_id with the teachers table.

```
ALTER TABLE students ADD CONSTRAINT my_fk FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers ON DELETE NO ACTION;
```
