# TDD with RSpec for Rails
Lecture on test driven development in Rails using RSpec.

# Objective
Students will be able to...

- write model specs
- write routing specs
- write controller specs
- emphasize the importance of test driving a Rails app
- decide if they want to include TDD in their job search as a requirement for companies

# Link
We have already covered TDD for a plain Ruby project, but need to explore the possibilities of TDD with Rails specifically. RSpec comes with a lot more methods we can use to test Rails than any other Ruby project.

# Educate and Engage & Active Learning
Code along! Let's code another blogging app, but this time, we will test drive it.

Most important takeaways:

- Rails comes with three environments by default: development, test, production, with a separate database for each
- [How to install RSpec in your Rails app](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)
- [How to install Shoulda Matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers)
- [How to install Factory Girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails)
- [How to write model specs](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/3-1/docs/model-specs)
- [How to write routing specs](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/3-1/docs/routing-specs)
- [How to write controller specs](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/3-1/docs/controller-specs)

# Now and Then
TDD will be a requirement for project 2. TDD FTW!
