# z-shell
Lecture on how to install and use z-shell

# Objective
Students will be able to...

- Use z-shell instead of bash
- Understand key benefits of using z-shell over bash

# Quick Lecture
z-shell has smarter auto-completion and shows Git information. Usage is optional, but recommended.

```shell
# Change into home directory
$ cd

# Download and install z-shell
$ curl -L https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh
```

Restart the terminal. z-shell should now be installed and loaded. Navigate into our wdi-sf-14 directory, and you will see that it displays current Git information, also after changing files.
