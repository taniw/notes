<p>I am a believer of making my life count. I have a healthy obsession with learning and enjoy hunting things that inspire good emotions for me: modern dance, long runs, a good book, preparing healthy foods, occasional dance parties, lots of laughter, big hugs, and meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>I currently work in SF at The Reset Foundation: breaking the poverty to prison cycle by creating an alternative approach to prison--one focused entirely on education, career, and healthy living. In my work, I have discovered amazing apps that are dramatically improving the learning experience for our students. I am excited about the way technology is transforming education.</p>
<p>Recently, I decided to pursue a long-held interest of creating mobile and web applications that help support and to some degree treat individuals struggling with addictions and mental health issues. I love design and good functionality and couldn't be more excited about developing new skills that hopefully produce more effective products.</p>
